# Configuration for package managers
# - Homebrew (formulae and casks)
# - asdf (runtime versions)
# - npm (global packages)

homebrew:
  # This section manages brew formulae and casks
  # - Commented out unused with # lines
  # - Sorted by basename (naturally sorted as tap info is after the comma)
  # - Properly separates casks from formulae
  # - Fully qualified formulae are written as: "basename, tap/path/"
  #   Example: "speedtest, teamookla/speedtest/" -> "teamookla/speedtest/speedtest"
  # - Moved Python stuff to its own section

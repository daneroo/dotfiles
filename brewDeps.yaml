# yaml-language-server: $schema=./brewDeps.schema.json

# This file manages brew formulae and casks
# - Commented out unused with # lines
# - Sorted by basename (naturally sorted as tap info is after the comma)
# - Properly separates casks from formulae
# - Fully qualified formulae are written as: "basename, tap/path/"
#   Example: "speedtest, teamookla/speedtest/" -> "teamookla/speedtest/speedtest"
# - Moved Python stuff to its own section
